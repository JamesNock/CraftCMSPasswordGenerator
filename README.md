# CraftCMS Password Generator

This is the repo that supports (https://craftcmspwgen.james-nock.co.uk).

This was the first time I built a project from scratch with Nuxt and/or Vue.

## Local development

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
